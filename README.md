## Welcome to Small-LibC!
Small-LibC is an iOS development library, which implements full ANSI C89, some C99 and POSIX functions

## Get started
If you're on iOS, just run `./make_all.sh`, then you'll be able to use it as libc.a (recommended way for on-device)

<details>
    <summary>If you're cross-compiling</summary>
If you're cross-compiling, go to ./src, then `make CROSS=1`. Supported Makefile flags are `SDK`, `ARCHES` (armv7 default, 4t,6,7s permitted, 2+ arches suppirted as `ARCHES=armv7,armv7s`), `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`. If you have cctools, use Makefile flag `LLVM-PREFIX=""` (default behavior is to call `$(LLVM-PREFIX)$(tool)`)
</details>

## Status
* Full ANSI C89
* Full POSIX.1-1990
* Some Mach syscalls implemented with libMach. To compile it (required for stdio), use `./getlibmach.sh`. It's very small.
* ANSI requires support for "C" locale only, which this library does. You can find Apple `LC_CTYPE` parser at `./src/sysindep/locale/unused`
* Some C99 is implemented (very partly) – e.g. you can use `%ls` and `%lc` and `snprintf()`

Note that LibM and string are git submodules, so run git submodule update --recursive --init before compiling (of course, if you need it. if don't, just `touch src/math/dummy.c` and it will pass)

## Structure

1. ./src – LibC's source
2. ./include – LibC's headers (some `sys` licensed under APSL, be careful!)
3. ./src/sysindep – Probably system-independent code
4. ./src/sysdep – "system-dependent" code: uses inline asm. can be used like `xnu-tree/libsyscall/custom`
5. ./src/runtime/sysdep – C Startup code
6. ./src/runtime/sysindep – stack canary, division runtime
7. ./src/math – libM

## Notes
### Why sysindep is "probably" system-independent?

TL;DL: I'm lazy

Actually, it should be named "c", not "sysindep", but I don't want to change it – I'm too lazy to rewrite Makefile and change `string` submodude path

### Is it compatible?

TL;DR: no, it's not.

(Actually, this library can be used with libSystem if you'll remove `./src/sysindep/stdio` – it's incompatible)

### Is dynamic linking supported?

TL;DR: no

And never be - dyld is complicated as hell. Sorry! T-T

### Is it thread-safe?

TL;DR: partly

`*alloc()`, `free()`, stdio functions are protected with spinlocks.

### Other standarts status & Feature test macro
We support some feature test macros, such aa `_ANSI_SOURCE`, `_XOPEN_SOURCE`, `_POSIX_C_SOURCE`, `_DARWIN_C_SOURCE`, `_GNU_SOURCE`, but only `_POSIX_SOURCE` and `_ANSI_SOURCE` are explicitly supported.
